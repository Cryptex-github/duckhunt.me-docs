description: Installing duckhunt on your server is easy

# Quickstart

First, Iâ€™d like to thank [HostMyServers](https://www.hostmyservers.fr/) for providing me a server to host DuckHunt on. It is fast, reliable and well-supported!

Adding the official bot to your server is super easy ! Follow the instructions:

* Join [our discord server ](https://discord.gg/2BksEkV)to get support if needed. 
* **Invite the bot to your server by clicking** [**here**](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=187636051135823872&permissions=70646849&scope=bot)**.**
* In the channel you want to use, type !setup and follow the instructions given to you.
* You should be asked to type `dh!add_channel`in the channel where you want the game to start. Do that and you'll be good to go.

Thanks for using DuckHunt! If you want to configure the bot, read [this](edit-settings-settings-list.md).
