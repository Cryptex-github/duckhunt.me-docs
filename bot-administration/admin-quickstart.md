# Quickstart

First, Iâ€™d like to thank [HostMyServers](https://www.hostmyservers.fr/) for providing me a server to host DuckHunt on. It is fast, reliable and well-supported!

Adding the official bot to your server is super easy! Follow the instructions:

* Join [our discord server ](https://discord.gg/2BksEkV)to get support if needed. 
* **Invite the bot to your server by clicking** [**here**](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=187636051135823872&permissions=70646849&scope=bot)**.**
* In the channel you want to use, type `dh!setup` and follow the instructions given to you.
* **You should be asked to type `dh!add_channel`in the channel where you want the game to start.** Do that and you'll be good to go.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to [configure settings](edit-settings-settings-list.md), you must do it in an **enabled channel**. However, parameters are server-wide, while scores are per-channel. If you want to edit settings in a staff channel, you can add it to the game temporarily, then run `dh!del_channel`to remove it once you edited settings.
{% endhint %}
