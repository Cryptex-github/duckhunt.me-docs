# Administrators quickstart

First, I'd like to thank [HostMyServers](https://www.hostmyservers.fr/) for providing me a server to host DuckHunt. It's fast, reliable and well-supported!

Adding the official bot to your server is super easy! Follow these instructions:

1. Join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/2BksEkV) to get support if needed.
2. Invite the bot to your server by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=187636051135823872&permissions=70646849&scope=bot).
3. Choose/create a channel where you want ducks to spawn
4. Subscribe that channel to \#announcements \(on the DuckHunt server\) to get messages about the bot status or breaking changes for players.
5. Type `dh!settings enabled True` to start the game.

## Configuration

Most commands are only available once the channel is enabled \(see nÂ°5 above\). It includes settings commands. Once you've done the above, you'll be able to configure the perfect settings. For this, just [head to the next page](edit-settings-settings-list.md).
