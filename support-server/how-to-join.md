{% endhint %}

We are open about how we moderate the server. A full, uncensored moderation log \(that contains every action a moderator may do on the server\), is viewable by anybody on the \#mod-log channel or on the [GetBeaned web interface](https://getbeaned.me/guilds/195260081036591104).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you were acted on by the thresholds enforcer, the following paragraph don't apply to you. Please appeal directly to Eyesofcreeper\#0001.
{% endhint %}

If you feel you have be warned/kicked/muted/banned unfairly, please discuss it with the moderator that made that action. GetBeaned should have sent you a DM when it happened, but just in case, use [this link](https://getbeaned.me/guilds/195260081036591104) to go to the web interface and search for your entry. You might have to add the mod as a "friend" if you were banned. **Please be respectful at all times.**

  
****If you still can't agree with the responsible moderator, you may appeal to Eyesofcreeper\#0001, by creating a 3-way DM with the responsible moderator and Eyesofcreeper\#0001. We'll try to firure out a solution together.
