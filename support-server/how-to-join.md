# How to join \(and rules\)

Join the DuckHunt support server at: [https://discord.gg/8WdXaZG](https://discord.gg/8WdXaZG)\*\*\*\*

{% hint style="danger" %}
### **Discord guidelines are enforced on the server.**

We abide by the **standard discord rules**. Please refer to [https://discordapp.com/guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines) for those.
{% endhint %}

Additionally, the following rules apply:

1. When requesting support, please try to show your research, what you tried and what you want exactly.
2. Do not use the support channels for general discussion. Ask your questions right away, and wait for your answer. 2B\) Support channels include, Support\_english; Support\_french; Support\_international; Bug\_report, Suggestions and Official\_tags.
3. Don't post an invite link, or any other advertisement, except at the request of a moderator.
4. Don't spam or disturb normal conversation flow.
5. Avoid pinging multiple people. If you ping @Moderators, you **MUST** have a good reason to do so. 
6. Any questionable content \(NSFW, or even suggestive\) is not allowed. Anything posted must be okay for 13-year-olds.
7. Nicknames must not contain offensive language or special characters to appear at the top of the list. Please try to make yourself easily mentionable if you request support.
8. Please try to reduce the number of images and memes you send in the general channels. Use \#glorieux-memes-de-france instead.
9. Do NOT DM members of the server **without prior approval**. That includes the staff, and it also prohibits asking for support in staff DMs, if we didn't ask you to do so first.



{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember, the mods and admins are always right. If they tell you that something is not allowed, don't complain.
{% endhint %}

We are open about how we moderate the server. A full, uncensored moderation log \(that contains every action a moderator may do on the server\), is viewable by anybody on the \#mod-log channel or on the [GetBeaned web interface](https://getbeaned.me/guilds/195260081036591104).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you were acted on by the thresholds enforcer, the following paragraph does not apply to you. Please appeal directly to **Eyesofcreeper\#0001**.
{% endhint %}

If you feel you have been warned/kicked/muted/banned unfairly, please discuss it with the moderator that made that action. GetBeaned should have sent you a DM when it happened, but just in case, use [this link](https://getbeaned.me/guilds/195260081036591104) to go to the web interface and search for your entry. You might have to add the mod as a "friend" if you were banned. Alternatively, you can join the [GetBeaned support](https://discord.gg/gT5pdgP) server and DM the mod that way. **Please be respectful at all times.**

  
****If you still can't agree with the responsible moderator, you may appeal to Eyesofcreeper\#0001, by creating a 3-way DM with the responsible moderator and Eyesofcreeper\#0001. We'll try to figure out a solution together.
