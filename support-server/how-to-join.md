# How to join \(and rules\)

Join the duckhunt support server at: [https://discord.gg/8WdXaZG](https://discord.gg/8WdXaZG)\*\*\*\*

{% hint style="danger" %}
### **Discord guidelines are enforeced on the server**

**We abide by the standard discord rules. Please refer to** [**https://discordapp.com/guidelines**](https://discordapp.com/guidelines) **for those.**
{% endhint %}

Additionally, the following rules apply:

1. Don't post an invite link, or any other advertising, except on request from a moderator.
2. Dont spam or disturb normal conversation flow.
3. Avoid pinging multiple people. If you ping @Moderators, you must have a good reason to do so. 
4. Any questionnable content \(NSFW, or even suggestive\) is not allowed. Anything posted must be okay for 13 years olds.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember, the mods and admins are always right. If they tell you that something is not allowed, don't complain.
{% endhint %}

We are open about how we moderate the server. A full, uncensored moderation log \(that contains every action a moderator may do on the server\), is viewable by anybody on the \#mod-log channel or on the [GetBeaned web interface](https://getbeaned.me/guilds/195260081036591104).

If you feel you have be warned/kicked/muted/banned unfairly, please discuss it with the moderator that made that action. GetBeaned should have sent you a DM when it happened, but just in case, use [this link](https://getbeaned.me/guilds/195260081036591104) to go to the web interface and search for your entry. You might have to add the mod as a "friend" if you were banned. **Please be respectful at all times.**  
If you still can't agree with the responsible moderator, you may appeal to Eyesofcreeper\#0001, by creating a 3-way DM with the responsible moderator and Eyesofcreeper\#0001. We'll try to firure out a solution together.
