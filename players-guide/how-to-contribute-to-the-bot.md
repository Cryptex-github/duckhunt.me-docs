# How to contribute to the bot

## Translating the bot

Translations are already available in a [lot of languages](https://duckhunt.me/commands/translators). However, if you feel one can be upgraded, made better or just finished, feel free to contact Eyesofcreeper\#0001 on the [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/2BksEkV).

Don't forget to tell me what language you want to translate the bot to. We use LingoHub to translate the bot, so I'll also need you email address to send you an invite.

Translators are credited in the [`dh!translators`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/translators) command, and get an exclusive [trophy](achievements-guide.md).

## Report bugs

You can report bugs on the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV4/issues) page. You might also want to visit \#bug-report on our [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/2BksEkV) for a more informal reporting process.

## Improve this documentation

Hey, thanks for wanting to improve the docs! There is [a specific page](../how-to-edit-this-wiki.md) for this that explains the process in detail. See you there!

## Help on the support server

You can join our support server using [this link](https://discord.gg/2BksEkV). Come and help us answer questions from beginners and confirmed people alike. If you want to get yourself familiar with the rules and commands first, [read here](../support-server/how-to-join.md).

You can give yourself the [Support Volunteer roles](../support-server/list-of-roles.md) if you can be pinged to answer questions.

## Edit the code

The DuckHunt bot is fully open sourced \(including the documentation, this website and everything needed to run it\). We really love pull-requests, even simple ones. If you need help with the code or the projet, feel free to ask me \(Eyesofcreeper\#0001\) on the support server.

These are all the projects you can contribute to:

* The [documentation](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/duckhunt.me-docs) you are currently reading \(edits links for specific pages are also available on the sidebar\). Written in markdown, very easy to edit for beginners and experts alike.
* The [bot](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV4) itself, with all the [commands](https://duckhunt.me/commands), and the [API](../the-duckhunt-api/channels-scores-and-stats.md). Written in Python, using the discord.py library.
* The [website](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV4_Web), used to format and display this documentation, but also to render statistics pages. Written using Django, HTML&CSS, Jinja2, and a touch of JS.
* The [docker config](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DuckHunt_Docker), tying all of this together, and allowing for an easy deployment of the bot.

## Donate

Hosting bots cost money, notwithstanding the hours spent on making DuckHunt the best game bot on discord, so if you can afford, donations are always welcome.
