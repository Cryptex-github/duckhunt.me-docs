# Players quickstart

## The basics

The goal of the game is to earn the most experience \(exp\) to be the top player on your channel leaderboard.

To earn experience, you must kill ducks \(click [here](types-of-ducks.md) to see what a duck looks like\). Most ducks killed will get you 10 exp \(assuming default settings\). However, sometimes you might find other [types of ducks](types-of-ducks.md) that are worth more experience.

To kill a duck, you need to shoot at it with your weapon using the `dh!bang` command. Assuming you're lucky, you'll hit the duck and earn experience. If you aren't, you might miss your shot. In that case, no worries, you can just retry by typing the command again. If your weapon gets confiscated, you'll have to wait until [`dh!freetime`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/freetime) or [buy it back from the shop](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/weapon) with your experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `dh!bang` command can often be reduced to simply `dhpan` or `!pan`. Many aliases are available, will you be able to [find them all](https://duckhunt.me/commands/bang) ?
{% endhint %}

You may also need to reload your weapon, either because you have no more bullets or because it jammed. No worries, the command is just [`dh!reload`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/reload).

## When you level up

Once you killed a few ducks, you should have enough experience to explore the [shop](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop), using the [`dh!shop`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop) command.

We recommend you buy a **silencer** to avoid letting the ducks flee from you \([`dh!shop silencer`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/silencer)\), a **clover,** so you earn \(way\) more experience for every kill \([`dh!shop clover`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/clover)\), and a **sight** to improve your aim \([`dh!shop sight`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/sight)\).

If you hunt a lot of ducks, you might run out of **magazines**. In that case, buy some from the shop \([`dh!shop 2`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/2)\). However, you may find magazines as you hunt ducks, so be sure to leave some magazines empty in order to pick these up for free. Try to be as close to zero magazines as possible since, at freetime, your magazine count gets refilled \(not your bullets tho, remember to reload\).

Soon, you'll level up enough and get better weapons, and you will be able to drop the silencer and sight, and use **explosive** ammo [`dh!shop explosive`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/explosive) instead.
