# Como jogar o DuckHunt

O Objetivo do jogo é ganhar o máximo de experiência para ser o melhor jogador na tabela de classificação do seu canal

Para ganhar pontos de experiência, você precisa matar os patos. Muitos patos morto garantem a você\(com base nas configurações iniciais\) 10 pontos de exp. Contudo, algumas vezes voce pode encontrar outros [tipos de patos](types-of-ducks.md) que dão mais pontos de experiência.

To kill a duck, you need to shoot at it with your weapon, using the `dh!bang` command. Assuming you are lucky, you'll hit the duck and win experience. If you aren't you might miss your shot. In that case, no worries, you can just retry by typing the command again. If your weapon gets confiscated, you will have to wait until `dhfreetime` or [buy it back from the shop](store-items.md) with your experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `dh!bang` command can often be reduced to simply `dhpan` or `!pan`. Many aliases are available, will you be able to find them all ?
{% endhint %}

You may also need to reload your weapon, either because you have no more bullets or because it jammed. No worries, the command is just `dh!reload`.   
  
Once you killed a few ducks, you should have got enough experience to explore the [shop](store-items.md), using the `dhbuy` command. 

We recommend you buy a **silencer** to avoid letting the ducks flee on you \(`dhshop silencer`\), a **clover** so you earn \(way\) more experience for every kill \(`dhshop clover`\),  a **sight** to improve your aim \(`dhshop sight`\). 

If you killed many ducks, you might ran out of **magazine**s. In that case, buy some from the shop \(`dhshop 2`\). You should never be full on magazines \(so you can keep those you might find for free after killing ducks\), and try to be as close to zero as possible since, for freetime, your magazines count get reflled \(not your bullets tho, remember to reload\).

Soon, you'll level up enough and get better weapons so you will be able to drom the silencer and sight, and use **explosive** ammo \(`dhshop explosive`\) instead.

If you read all of this, you might now be well on your way to become a Pro DuckHunter™️. Have fun with the game, and make sure you ask any question on the [support server](https://discordapp.com/invite/2BksEkV).
