# FAQ

## How do I play?

The best way would be to read [our players guide](players-quickstart.md).

## How do I install the bot?

See the [QuickStart](../bot-administration/admin-quickstart.md)!

## Can I see the source code?

Sure you can! Head to [GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV3/issues) for it!

## I want to self-host DuckHunt/I want my own copy of DuckHunt. How do I do it?

This is clearly not recommended. The official bot is the best choice in 99.9% of the cases. Note that no support will be given for self hosted versions, and you have to update the bot in a timely fashion. However, if you still want to try it, instructions are given on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV3/issues).

## I found a bug! Where should I go?

Congratulations! You can go to [our support server](https://discordapp.com/invite/2BksEkV) to report it, or open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV3/issues).

## I have a feature request/suggestion!

That's not really a question, but you can go to [GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV3/issues) to suggest things!

## I love you!

Me too ! ❤️
