# Tips

### **To get good at duckhunt you need to be able to manage your XP wisely.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Watch the freetime!   
I**f the freetime timer expires, you get your gun \(if it's confiscated\) and some ammo clips for free. use  \(`dhfreetime`\) to see when the freetime happens.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Keep a slot open for new clips!**  
You can find clips in bushes after killing a duck sometimes. -if you have max clips it gets deleted, and that wastes 13 **-**!
{% endhint %}

### **Early game**

In the beginning you start with a bad gun with alot of bullets per clip and abysmal accuracy. At this moment buying clips is better than buying bullets. I recommend getting a 4-leaf clover \(`dhbuy 10`\) if you have more than 20 XP and then just shoot any duck you can.   
I also recommend buying a sight for the early game \(`dhbuy 7`\) to minimize missed shots and chances for accidents.  
You could buy grease to stop jamming, but i reckon it's a waste of XP.  
You could get a infrared detector to help save bullets and -2 XP, but i'd just use `dhhug` to see if there is a duck when i'm not sure.

### **Late game**

Eventually you'll get a fancy sniper with 1 bullet per clip. at this point in the game buying bullets is better than buying clips. Also a 4-leaf clover\(`dhbuy 10`\) is necessary for being in the top, and a infrared detector\(`dhbuy 8`\) is recommended.   
You can always drop 4 or 5 bread pieces on a channel and hope it lures more ducks.   
\(`dhbuy 21`\)

**Other items**  
Things like the silencer, the decoy, and the insurances or anti sabotage items are all a waste of XP if you play the game right. only buy the  insurances or anti sabotage items _****_**If you think you are a target for other players.**   
\(`dhbuy 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 18 or 20` are all of the anti-sabotage or ""XP waste"" items; please refer to [Shop items](store-items.md)\)  
****Explosive ammo \(`dhbuy 4`\) may be worth it if you are competing with other hunters or if you are at an high level, where bullets cost more.
