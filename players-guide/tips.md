# Tips

To get good at duckhunt you need to be able to manage your XP wisely.

**Early game**  
In the beginning you start with a bad gun with alot of bullets per clip and abysmal accuracy. At this moment buying clips is better than buying bullets. I recommend getting a 4-leaf clover if you have more than 50 XP and just then shoot any duck you can. You could buy grease to stop jamming, but i reckon it's a waste of XP.  
You could get a infrared detector to help save bullets and -2 XP, but i'd just do dh!hug to see if there is a duck when i'm not sure.

**Late game**  
Eventually you'll get a fancy sniper with 1 bullet per clip. at this point in the game buying bullets is better than buying clips. Also a clover is necessary for being in the top, and a silencer is recommended.   
You can always drop 4 or 5 bread pieces on a channel and hope it lures more ducks.

**Other items**  
Things like the silencer, the lure and the insurances or anti sabotage items are all a waste of XP if you play the game right. only buy the  insurances or anti sabotage items _****_**If you think you are a target for other players.**
