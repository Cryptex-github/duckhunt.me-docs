# Tips

### **To get good at duckhunt you need to be able to manage your experience wisely.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Watch the freetime!   
I**f the freetime timer expires, you get your gun \(if it's confiscated\) and some ammo clips for free. use  \(`dhfreetime`\) to see when the freetime happens.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Keep a slot open for new clips!**  
You can find clips in bushes after killing a duck sometimes. -if you have max clips it gets deleted, and that wastes 13 experience**-**!
{% endhint %}

### **Early game**

In the beginning you start with a bad gun with alot of bullets per clip and abysmal accuracy. At this moment buying clips is better than buying bullets. I recommend getting a 4-leaf clover \(`dhbuy 10`\) if you have more than 20 experience points and then just shoot any duck you can.   
I also recommend buying a sight for the early game \(`dhbuy 7`\) to minimize missed shots and chances for accidents.  
You could buy grease to stop jamming, but I reckon it's a waste of XP.  
You could get a infrared detector to help save bullets and -2 XP, but i'd just use `dhhug` to see if there is a duck when I'm not sure.

A silencer is really useful early game, since you miss loads of shots and these can still scare ducks.

### **Late game**

Eventually you'll get a fancy sniper rifle with only 1 bullet per clip. at this point in the game buying bullets is better than buying clips. Also a 4-leaf clover \(`dhbuy 10`\) is necessary to get on top, and a infrared detector \(`dhbuy 8`\) is really recommended to avoid waste.   
You can always drop 4 or 5 bread pieces on a channel and hope it lures more ducks.   
\(`dhbuy 21`\)

Avoid buying some items, most are not worth it at this point. Grease, Silencers, ...  
Most of the anti-sabotage items, such as the weapon cleaning, are useless and should not be brought.

**Never ever buy the life insurance.** It's simply not worth it.
