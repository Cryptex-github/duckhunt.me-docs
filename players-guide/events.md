# Events

Events happen globally, at the same time, and across all of discord. They will change gameplay and make hunting ducks more fun. Every hour, there is a 10% chance an event will be applied \(lasting an hour\). If an event is to be drawn, it is chosen from the list of events with equal probability. This means that there should be approximately 2 events per day.

{% hint style="success" %}
To display the current event, you can use the `dh!event`command.
{% endhint %}

### Everything is calm

> Nothing is happening right now.

This means that the game is running normally.

### Ducks are migrating

> Prepare to see more ducks in the next hour.

There is a 10% chance that 2 ducks will spawn instead of one.

### Foggy weather

> It's harder to see killed ducks. You'll need a few more seconds to know if you missed or not.

The bang\_lag [setting](../bot-administration/edit-settings-settings-list.md) is up by 3 seconds. It means that you'll only get the result of your shot 3 seconds after running the bang command.

### Steroids in the lake

> A medical waste company dumped steroids into the lake.   
> Ducks have mutated, and you'll see a lot more Super Ducks. But, be careful, and don't drink that water.

There is approximately a 20% more chance for a duck to be a Super Duck.

### Safety class canceled

> The safety class was canceled. Beware of shooting other hunters!

There is a 5% more chance you'll shoot another hunter when you miss a shot. Normally, this globally means 7% chance of killing on miss. This is one of the worst event, don't forget to [buy a sight](store-items.md) to reduces misses.

### Connection problems

> Ducks cant find your computer due to connection problems, and there will be less of them until it's repaired.

There is a 10% chance a duck that should have spawned gets canceled.

### A new florist in town

> A new florist opened in town, and you can now find better 4-leaf-clovers. Go check them out!

One of the best events. This adds 10 exp to the upper bound of clover exp. Normally, when you buy a clover, it'll give you from 1 to 10 exp points more for every duck you kill. With this event, the clover experience will be rolled between 1 and 20!

### Mega-ducks

> Someone inflated a super duck, and now theyâ€˜re EVEN BIGGER!!

Super Ducks get 3 more lives.

### Windy weather

> Bullets are deflected by strong wind

There is an 8% more chance you'll miss a shot. The sight is not really useful with this event.

### Restarting

Not really an event, the bot is making every duck leave prior to the restart. No ducks are allowed to spawn anymore. This goes for approximately 15 minutes before the bot is able to shut down.
