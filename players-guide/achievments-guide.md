# Achievements guide

## Achievements

Achievements are stateless, meaning that you don't keep them for life but you rather have to meet a condition to get them. If you no longer meet the condition, then your achievement will disappear.

Therefore, because of the clueless/scientist achievement pair, it is **not possible** to get all the achievements at the same time.

### Time Played I

### Time Played II

For this one, you need to have played on 30 different days.

### Baby Lover
