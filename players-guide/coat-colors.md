# Coat colors

Since [DuckHunt V4.1](../whats-new-in-duckhunt-v4.md), when buying a [coat in the shop](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/coat) you'll be given a randomly colored coat. Additionally, with [prestige level 2](levels-and-experience.md#prestige-levels) or more, you are even able to select a specific color yourself \(`dh!shop coat <color>`\).

Every color will give you a small, different power up. 

### White coat

> A useful coat when it rains

### Orange coat

> Better visibility: Increase your chance to frighten ducks, and reduce your chance to get shot by another hunter.

### Camo coat 

> Lower visibility: Less chance to frighten ducks.

### Blue coat

> Lucky find: Increase your chance to find items in bushes.

### Red coat

> Hungry for blood: Increase your murder skills, reduce murder penalties.

### Yellow coat

> Sun powers: Mirrors are less effective against you.

### Dark green coat

> Farming skills: Clovers give you one more experience point.

### Black coat

> Secret service: Sabotages are cheaper.

### Light blue coat

> Sea powers: You are immune to water buckets.

\(As do all the other coats, so this one is indeed useless\)

### Pink coat

> Power of love: You can't kill players with the same coat color.
