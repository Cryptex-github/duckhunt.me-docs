# Achievements guide

Achievements are a way for you to prove how great of a hunter you are to the world \(or at least, your channel\).

They shouldn't be confused with trophies, that are global \(=on all channels\) achievements given by the bot staff.

You can't obtain trophies in game, but you can get all the achievements from the comfort of your channel.

## Achievements

This guide will help you unlock all the achievements on your channel. Beware, the following might contain spoilers.

### Murderer

> Kill another hunter.

**How to obtain:** You can kill a hunter willingly by typing [`dh!bang <mention>`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/bang)

### Big spender

> Spend more than 2000 experience.

**How to obtain:** Spend experience in the [shop](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop). [Homing bullets](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/homing) is the most expensive item you can find in there, but also very useless.

### A hunter joined the chat

> Play for more than a week.

**How to obtain:** Type a hunting command \([bang](https://duckhunt.me/commands/bang), [reload](https://duckhunt.me/commands/reload)\) on 7 different days.

### We are starting to know each other

> Play for more than a month.

**How to obtain:** Type a hunting command \([bang](https://duckhunt.me/commands/bang), [reload](https://duckhunt.me/commands/reload)\) on 30 different days.

### Wanna be friends ?

> Play for more than a year.

**How to obtain:** Type a hunting command \([bang](https://duckhunt.me/commands/bang), [reload](https://duckhunt.me/commands/reload)\) on 365 different days.

### I don't want your damn bullets!

> Leave a bullet you found in the bushes.

**How to obtain:** This one is very hard to get, and you'll probably need [prestige level â‰¥ 8](levels-and-experience.md) . You need to be at the end of level 6, whit a full clip, kill a duck that makes you level up, and have enough luck to find a bullet in the bushes.

### Mommy is crying

> Kill a few baby ducks.

**How to obtain:** Kill at least 5 baby ducks.

### MATHS 101

> Solve equations given by the Pr. Duck.

**How to obtain:** Kill five Pr. Ducks.

### BRAAAAAINS!

> Eat some brains and come back to life.

**How to obtain:** Get someone to kill you \(accidentally or not\), and [revive](https://duckhunt.me/commands/revive) yourself

### Sentry gun

> Use more than 1000 bullets.

**How to obtain:** You can either play for a while, or just spam the [bang](https://duckhunt.me/commands/bang) command, since wasted bullets count.

### Homing kills \(you\)

> Use the homing projectiles.

**How to obtain:** Get 150 exp and buy [homing projectiles](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/homing_bullets), then shoot at a duck.

### You monster

> Kill a MOAD that spawns a baby duck.

**How to obtain:** Kill many MOADs, one day you'll be lucky enough to get a baby duck to spawn.

### Gun insurer

> Give at least 30 exp to an hunter that lost his gun.

**How to obtain:** Use the [send\_exp](https://duckhunt.me/commands/send_exp) command to send some of your experience to another hunter that lost his gun. The amount is counted before taxes, so `dh!send_exp <@user> 30` should work just fine.

### Short memory

> Shoot at your own mechanical duck.

**How to obtain:** Buy a [mechanical duck](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/mechanical), and kill it.

### An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure

> Sabotage the gun of someone that planned to shoot at you.
