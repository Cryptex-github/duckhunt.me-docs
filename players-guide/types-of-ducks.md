More details will be provided below the follwoing quick-refrerence table.

| Duck name | characteristics |

| Regular duck | Just your basic duck with 1 HP and awards the default 10XP. |
| Baby duck | You must hug the baby! shooting it will lose XP. |
| Super duck | A duck with more than 1 HP, a bit random how much, usually between 2-9, gives huge amounts of XP depending on the HP. |

### The regular ducks

The regular duck is the duck you'll find the most frequently. It has only one HP and can be killed in one shot. By default, this duck will award you 10 experience points.

### The babies

Babies aren't yet grown up, and so you shouldn't kill them to preserve later supplies of ducks. Show them some love with the `!hug` command instead.

Babies have special emotes, so you can recognise them easily. Also, they haven't learned to speak yet, so they always say **COIN!**

### The super ducks

Super ducks look just like regular ducks. Only when you shoot them do you see a message saying "The duck survived, try again! _SUPER DUCK DETECTED_ \[Life: -1 \(current life/maxlife\)\]"

To kill super ducks faster you need AP ammo or explosive ammo, which do 2 or 3 damage respectively.

### The MOADs

**MOAD** stands for **M**other **O**f **A**ll **D**ucks, they spawn 2 ducks when killed.  
They always say "**I AM... Your mother"**

the ducks that spawn \(are always normal / can be any type\).
