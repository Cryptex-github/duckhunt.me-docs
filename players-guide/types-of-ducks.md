### The regular ducks

The regular duck is the duck you'll find the most frequently. It has only one HP and can be killed in one shot. By default, this duck will award you 10 experience points.

### The babies

Babies aren't yet grown up, and so you shouldn't kill them to preserve later supplies of ducks. Show them some love with the `!hug` command instead.

Babies have special emotes, so you can recognise them easily. Also, they haven't learned to speak yet, so they always say **COIN!**
