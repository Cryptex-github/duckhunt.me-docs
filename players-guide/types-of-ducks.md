# Types of ducks

Many ducks can spawn on your channel, and it's your responsibility to recognise them and act appropriately.

## Normal ducks

This duck is the "basic" duck, the one that you'll encounter the most. Killing him is easy : just type `dh!bang`, and it
should die immediately (if you can shoot, and if you don't miss your shot).

### Golden

This duck is worth 1.5x more experience (15 exp). Make sure you shoot at it first.

### Plastic

This duck will only give you half the experience of a normal duck (5 exp). On higher levels, it may not be worth it to
shoot this duck.

### Kamikaze

This duck is just like a normal duck, but if you leave it alone for too long, instead of just wander away, it'll KILL
all the ducks alive on the channel. Don't wait until it despawns !

### Ghost

This duck does *not* send a spawn message. You must be vigilent if you kill one : the duck you intended to kill isn't
dead yet.

The best way to find them is by hugging the air, since this won't waste bullets.

### Prof (Pr. Duck.)

The professor requires you to do some math to kill it. Answer the question in the spawn message. To kill it, use the
`dh!pan <number>` command. For example, if you see a prof spawning with

> Huh, quick question, what's 16 + 91 ?

You must use `dh!pan 107` to kill it. Wrong answers **WILL** waste your bullet.

### Baby

Do **not** shoot at this duck, doing so would cost you a normal duck worth of experience (10 exp), and your bullet(s)!

Instead, you must [`dh!hug`](https://duckhunt.me/commands?command=hug) the duck to make it leave. Hugging ducks don't
waste bullets.

### Mechanical

Technically, a mechanical duck is not a duck, and shouldn't be shot at. They can sometimes spawn from the wild, but they
are most often [bought by other hunters in the shop](https://duckhunt.me/commands?command=shop%20mechanical).

{% hint style="info" %} If another duck spawns after a mechanical duck, the mechanical will leave silently. You do not
have to wait for it to leave. {% endhint %}

## Super ducks

Super ducks are ducks with multiple lives. Killing them may require multiple shots, or at
least [Armor Piercing](https://duckhunt.me/commands?command=shop%20ap) or
[explosive](https://duckhunt.me/commands?command=shop%20explosive) ammo.

However, with such a big number of lives, killing them
will [get you more experience](https://duckhunt.me/docs/bot-administration/edit-settings-settings-list#Experience-related%20settings)
than usual.

### Armored

This duck will resist 1 dmg on almost (90%) every shot. To kill him, you should have at least
some [AP](https://duckhunt.me/commands?command=shop%20ap) ammo equipped.

During the [UN Treaty event](https://duckhunt.me/docs/players-guide/events#UN%20Treaty), the armored duck does not
resist shots as that would be unfair to hunters. It'll then act as a normal Super Duck, but still count towards your
Armored kills !

You can see on your personal Hunter Page (`dh!me`) the amont of shots an armored duck resisted.

### MOAD (Mother Of All Ducks)

Mothers are normal Super ducks that will spawn two new, random ducks once killed. The spawned ducks doesn't count
towards the [ducks_per_day setting](http://127.0.0.1:8000/commands?command=settings%20ducks_per_day), and may be of any
type.

If a baby spawns after you've killed a MOAD, check your [achievements](achievements-guide.md) ! You'll have
unlocked `You monster`.

## Boss duck

The boss is a unique duck that will only spawn on the Official DuckHunt Support server. When killed, instead of
experience, you'll get a lootbox (box of foie gras) delivered to your
inventory. [Use](https://duckhunt.me/commands?command=inventory%20use) it
on ([almost](https://duckhunt.me/commands?command=settings%20allow_global_items)) any channel.
