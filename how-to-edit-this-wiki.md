# How to edit this wiki

The edition panel is located [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@duckhunt/s/duck-hunt-discord/), and you'll need a GitBook account to access it. Once you've registered, please join the support [server](https://discordapp.com/invite/2BksEkV) and ask for an invite to the project. Editions are attributed to your GitBook account and published on GitHub for transparency.
