# How to edit this wiki

The edition panel is located [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@duckhunt/s/duck-hunt-discord/), and you'll need a GitBook account to access it. Once you registered, please come to the support server and ask for an invite to the project. Editions are attributed to your gitbook account and published on GitHub for transparency.
