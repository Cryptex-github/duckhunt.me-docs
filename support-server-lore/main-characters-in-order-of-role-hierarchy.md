Subtleknifewielder#1927

(251996890369884161) | Arguably regarded as the moderator with the most power/highest standing (marked as "admin" of the DuckHunt bot in the coding for a while), although they should be acknowledged as holding equal representation. 32 years old. American. **Never sleeps**. Loves Subway. Never played Minecraft. Taoshi#0001

His birthday is on December 1st, he just thought you should know. You should get him a pear for his birthday, he likes them more then apples. He likes Minecraft.... Olpouin#6797

(183273311503908864) | French. Has a big butt. Loves Star Wars. Was one of the first people in the DuckHunt server, and has most likely been a moderator the longest. Enjoys Minecraft.. steefgozercool#6710

(380118196742651906) | Probably from Britain. Never talks. Extremely small chance that he is the developer of Minecraft... ironic toblerone | (undisclosed) Calgeka#5963 (465207298890006529) | French! One of our favorite artists at DH. Roleplaying games are best for Calgeka. Is capable of jumping an entire block in Minecraft, but "building is stupid." 0/0#0001 (661660243033456652) | Canadian. Bot developer. Plays TTD. Likes Tim Tarts and bacon. Used to play Minecraft, but is too busy with new projects. Sys#9661 (642434814968070148) | Texan. Forever Rolling that Boulder. Never heard of Minecraft, but likes Kraftwerk. Recently lost his mind. Uses two spaces between sentences, making it easy to track who creates these.
