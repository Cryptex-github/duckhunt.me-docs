# The DuckHunt bot

This wiki was created for DuckHunt\#0550, a Discord bot developed by Eyesofcreeper\#0001. This wiki will serve as a collection of the bots information, including the bots features \(including commands and settings\), a guide for using the features, along with information on the support server hosted on Discord. Below is a brief description of the bot:  
  
DuckHunt is a Discord bot, best categorized as gaming/entertainment. You use commands to hunt 'ducks' through the chat. Commands are executed in the form of "prefix\(command\)". The bot recognizes the prefix, reads the commands, and responds accordingly. Default prefixes are "dh", "!", and "dh!" For example, a typical command would look like `dhbang`.

The goal of DuckHunt is to outrank other duck hunters by amassing a large amount of exp through hunting ducks. However, exp doubles as a measure of rank and a form of currency. Exp can be spent buying shop items. Shop items are items that can give you a slight advantage while hunting. Because shop items cost exp, buying them may cause you to drop in rank. You will always get a higher return on your investment in shop items if you are vigilant. 

The ducks you hunt are recorded in the DuckHunt hunting log, which tracks the total amount of ducks hunted on the Discord channel. This log also provides the statistics of individual hunters, including how fast a duck was hunted, how many ducks were hunted, and more.
