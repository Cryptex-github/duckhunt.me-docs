# The DuckHunt bot

## What is DuckHunt ?

[DuckHunt](https://duckhunt.me) is an entertaining Discord bot. You use commands to hunt [ducks](players-guide/types-of-ducks.md) through the chat. For example, a typical command would look like `dh!bang` . The goal of DuckHunt is to outrank other duck hunters by amassing a large amount of experience \(exp\) through hunting ducks. However, exp doubles as a measure of rank, and as a form of currency. Experience can be spent [in the shop](./). Shop items are items that can give you a slight advantage while hunting. Because shop items cost exp, buying them may cause you to drop in rank. You will always get a higher return on your investment in shop items if you are vigilant. The ducks you hunt are recorded in the DuckHunt hunting log \(this website\), which tracks the total amount of ducks hunted on your Discord channel. This log also provides the statistics of individual hunters, including how fast and how many ducks were hunted, and more.

## How to read this wiki

This wiki host general information about the game, it is _not_ tailored to your specific channel! For this reason, the prefix \(`dh!`\) used on those pages is a **general prefix**, working on every server. That said, you can usually use a shorter prefix, by default `!`. To find out what prefix is used on your server, you can have a look at the channels settings page.

Unless specified otherwise, we assume that your server uses the default settings. If you run with heavily customised settings, except things to change.
